Experiment 1: 
    Oct 7 @ 9:15 PM
    Random Genotype.random_genotype_m1(4, 0, 4, 4, 1) created for each actor upon instantiation
        - single level back, 4x4 layers

    Output folder: o1

    Future experiments:
        - try a universal, single robust circuit template for each actor
        - try 3 levels back
        - lower mutation rate to 0.05
