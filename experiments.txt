Experiment 1: 
    Oct 7 @ 9:15 PM
    Random Genotype.random_genotype_m1(4, 0, 4, 4, 1) created for each actor upon instantiation
        - single level back, 4x4 layers
        - mutation rate: 0.1

    Output folder: o1

    Future experiments:
        - try a universal, single robust circuit template for each actor
        - try 3 levels back
        - lower mutation rate to 0.01

    Observations:
        - gradual decrease in complexity, but not nearly has drastic as previous experiments


Experiment 2: 
    Oct 7 @ 9:29 PM
    Random Genotype.random_genotype_m1(4, 0, 4, 4, 3) created for each actor upon instantiation
        - 3 level back, 4x4 layers
        - mutation rate: 0.01

    Output folder: o2

    Future experiments:
        - (try a universal, single robust circuit template for each actor)
        - try 1 level back, 4x4 layers with a 0.01 mutation rate
        - output fitness value alonside complexity
        - try on standard random generated circuit, non block
        - investigate payoff matrix
            - have same payouts with a negated converse for cases of cooperation when supposed to be competitive, and vice versa
            - reward proper instances of interactions the same, and penalize the same as well

    Observations:
        - casual fluxations in the complexity of every actor but the counterprotestors, who steadily decrease
