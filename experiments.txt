Experiment 1: 
    Oct 7 @ 9:15 PM
    Random Genotype.random_genotype_m1(4, 0, 4, 4, 1) created for each actor upon instantiation
        - single level back, 4x4 layers
        - mutation rate: 0.1

    Output folder: o1

    Future experiments:
        - try a universal, single robust circuit template for each actor
        - try 3 levels back
        - lower mutation rate to 0.01

    Observations:
        - gradual decrease in complexity, but not nearly has drastic as previous experiments


Experiment 2: 
    Oct 7 @ 9:29 PM
    Random Genotype.random_genotype_m1(4, 0, 4, 4, 3) created for each actor upon instantiation
        - 3 level back, 4x4 layers
        - mutation rate: 0.01

    Output folder: o2

    Future experiments:
        - (try a universal, single robust circuit template for each actor)
        - try 1 level back, 4x4 layers with a 0.01 mutation rate
        - output fitness value alonside complexity
        - try on standard random generated circuit, non block
        - investigate payoff matrix
            - have same payouts with a negated converse for cases of cooperation when supposed to be competitive, and vice versa
            - reward proper instances of interactions the same, and penalize the same as well

    Observations:
        - casual fluxations in the complexity of every actor but the counterprotestors, who steadily decrease

Experiment 3: 
    Oct 7 @ 11:00 PM
    Random Genotype.random_genotype_m1(4, 0, 4, 4, 3) created for each actor upon instantiation
        - 3 level back, 4x4 layers
        - mutation rate: 0.01
        - payoff matrix has same payouts across instances of collaboration and cooperation

    Output folder: o3

    Future experiments:
        - larger initial population sizes (50 -> 100)

        - 1 level back, 4x4 layers
        - mutation rate: 0.01
        - payoff matrix has same payouts across instances of collaboration and cooperation

    Output folder: o4

    Future experiments:
        - larger initial population sizes (50 -> 100)

    Observations:
        - steady decrease in Police complexity, but everything else holding steady



Experiment 5: 
    Oct 8 @ 1:19 PM
    Random Genotype.random_genotype_m1(4, 0, 4, 4, 1) created for each actor upon instantiation
        - 1 level back, 4x4 layers

        - payoff matrix has same payouts across instances of collaboration and cooperation
        - 100 population size

    Output folder: o5

    Future experiments:
        - different fitness measure?

    Observations:
        need more data

Experiment 6: 
    Oct 8 @ 4:12 PM
    Random Genotype.random_genotype_m1(4, 0, 4, 4, 3) created for each actor upon instantiation
        - 3 level back, 4x4 layers
        - mutation rate: 0.01
        - payoff matrix has same payouts across instances of collaboration and cooperation
        - 50 population size

    Output folder: o3

    Continuation of EXPERIMENT 3

    Observations:
        - general logarithmic complexity trends for all, except for protestors, who drop off gradually
        

Experiment 7: 
    Oct 8 @ 7:45 PM
    Random Genotype.random_genotype_m1(4, 0, 4, 4, 3) created for each actor upon instantiation
        - 3 level back, 4x4 layers
        - mutation rate: 0.01
        - payoff matrix has same payouts across instances of collaboration and cooperation
        - 50 population size
        - Actor traits now have <1 probabilities

    Output folder: o7

    Future experiments:
        - try without mutating traits
        - find optimal strategy for actor and penalize based on how far off the actor is?
    
    Observations:
        - slight increase in complexity for all except Police (perhaps because Police actor only has two relationships?)

Experiment 8: 
    Oct 9 @ 6:48 PM
    Random Genotype.random_genotype_m1(4, 0, 4, 4, 3) created for each actor upon instantiation

        - 50 population size
        - Actor traits now have <1 probabilities
        - Running new activation and deactivation mutation scheme

    Output folder: o8

    Future experiments:
        - craft the network dimensions such that the number of nodes in the output layer is less than that of the preceeding layers
        - check the source of mutation_v2
            - remove "if G.value_bindings is not None:"

        - run on old payoff matrix

        - run over 5000 iterations

        - choose nodes to activate and deactivate based on positional probabilities
